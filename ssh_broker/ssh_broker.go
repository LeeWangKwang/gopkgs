/*
	Mnemonic:	ssh_broker
	Abstract: 	Provides an interface to the ssh package that allows a local script (shell or python)
				to be read and sent to a remote host for execution.  The standard error and output are
				returned. Ssh connections are established using one or more private key files that
				are supplied when the broker object is created, and the connections persist until 
				the object is closed allowing for subsequent commands to be executed without the 
				overhead of the ssh setup.  

				Scripts must have a #! line which is used to execute the interpreter on the remote
				host.  The script is then written on stdin to the interpreter.  If python is in the 
				#! line, then leading whitespace isn't stripped as the script is sent to the remote host.  
				Commented lines (beginning with #), and blank lines are removed (might cause issues
				for strings with embedded newlines, but for now I'm not worrying about those).

				When the broker object is crated, a single script initiator is started, however it is 
				possible for the user application to start additional initiators in order to execute
				scripts in parallel.  The initiators read from the queue of scripts to run and 
				create a session, send the script, and wait for the results which are returned to the 
				caller directly, or as a message structure on a channel, depending on which function 
				was used. 

				There also seems to be a limit on the max number of concurrent sessions that one SSH
				connection will support.  This seems to be a host policy, rather than a blanket SSH
				constant, so an initiator will retry the execution of a script when it appears that the
				failrue is related to this limit.  All other errors are returned to the caller for 
				evaluation and possbile retry. 

				There are two functions that the user can invoke to run a script on a remote host:
				Run_on_host() and NBRun_on_host().  The former will block until the command is run 
				and the latter will queue the request with the caller's channel and the results message
				will be written to the channel when the script execution has been completed. 

				Basic usage:	(error checking omitted)
						// supply the key filenames that are recognised on the remote side in authorised keys
						keys := []string { "/home/scooter/.ssh/id_rsa", "/home/scooter/.ssh/id_dsa" }
						broker := Mk_broker( "scooter", keys )			// create a broker for user, with keys
						host := "cheetah"
						script := "/user/bin/do_something"					// can be in PATH, or qualified
						parms := "-t 10 /tmp/output"						// command line parameters
						stdout, stderr, err := broker.Run_on_host( host, script, parms )

				The script may be Korn shell, bash, or python and is fed into the interpreter as standard
				in put so $0 (arg[0]) will not be set.  The broker will attempt to set the variable 
				ARGV0 to be the script name should the script need it. Other than this small difference, 
				and there not being any standard input, the script should function as written.  It is possible
				that other script types can be used, though it is known that #!/usr/bin/env awk will fail and
				thus "pure awk" must be wrapped inside of a ksh or bash script.
