	Defines a message. Request and response data pointers are used so that in the case
	where the requesting thread is not blocking on the response the request data will
	be available for response processing if needed. A third data field, requestor_data
	is another hook to assist with asynch response processing. This is assumed to point
	to a data object that is of no significance to the receiver of the message when
	the message is a request.  It should be nil if the response channel is also nil.

	The struct allows the application to define how it is used, and does not really imply
	any meaning on the fields.
